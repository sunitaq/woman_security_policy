    <h1>Privacy Policy — <span>Shiva Lite</span></h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>17 September 2025</strong> &nbsp;•&nbsp; Contact: <a href="mailto:sunitaq780@gmail.com">sunitaq780@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p class="lead">Welcome to Shiva Lite — a lightweight, fully offline fighting and survival game. This document explains how the game handles data and privacy-related matters.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section aria-labelledby="overview">
      <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Shiva Lite is deliberately designed to work <strong>completely offline</strong>. The game plays entirely on the user's device and does not depend on a network connection for core gameplay. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain what (if any) information the game accesses, how that information is used, and how you can contact the developer with questions.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="data-collection">
      <h2 id="data-collection">2. Data Collection</h2>
      <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> Shiva Lite does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information about players. Examples of data we do not collect include names, email addresses, phone numbers, device identifiers collected remotely, precise geolocation, or profile information.</p>

      <p><strong>Local game data:</strong> The game may store gameplay-related data locally on the device such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saved settings and preferences (sound volume, control sensitivity, etc.).</li>
        <li>Local progress or checkpoint saves if you enable or use in-game saving features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All such data is stored locally on the player’s device and is not transmitted to any server or third party.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="permissions">
      <h2 id="permissions">3. App Permissions</h2>
      <p>Shiva Lite seeks only the minimal device permissions required for local functionality. Typical permissions (if requested) may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage / File access:</strong> Used only to read or write local save files, configuration, or exported data. The game will not read or upload files from your device to any external service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you do not grant optional permissions, core gameplay remains available whenever possible. Android and iOS may present different permission names — please review the permission prompt shown by your device store before granting access.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="ads-third-party">
      <h2 id="ads-third-party">4. Ads, Analytics & Third Parties</h2>
      <p>As of the effective date, Shiva Lite does <strong>not</strong> include advertisements, third-party analytics, or tracking SDKs.</p>
      <p>If advertisements, analytics, or any third-party services are added in a future update, the developer will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publish an updated Privacy Policy with the change date and details.</li>
        <li>Describe what third-party services are used and how they process data.</li>
        <li>Provide opt-out instructions where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="children">
      <h2 id="children">5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Shiva Lite is appropriate for all ages. Because the game does not collect any personal data, it is compliant with regulations designed to protect children’s privacy (for example, COPPA in the U.S.) to the extent that those rules apply to apps that collect personal information. If the game’s data practices change in the future, the developer will update this policy and include any necessary parental consent mechanisms.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="security">
      <h2 id="security">6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Because we do not transmit or centrally store personal data, there is no remote data that could be breached. Local save files remain on the device and are subject to the device’s own security mechanisms. Players are responsible for backing up any local save files they wish to keep.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="legal">
      <h2 id="legal">7. Legal Rights & International Laws</h2>
      <p><strong>GDPR / CCPA:</strong> Shiva Lite does not process personal data as defined under GDPR or CCPA in its current form. If that changes, the developer will add mechanisms to comply with applicable laws (access, correction, deletion, portability, and opt-out rights) and update this policy accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Lawful requests:</strong> Should the developer ever receive a lawful request from an authority, the developer will follow applicable law. Since we do not store personal data centrally, we cannot provide data we never had.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="changes">
      <h2 id="changes">8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. When material changes occur (for example, adding ads or online features), the policy will be updated with a new "Effective date" and a summary of the changes. It is recommended players review the policy occasionally for updates.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="contact">
      <h2 id="contact">9. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or game behavior, please contact the developer at:</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:sunitaq780@gmail.com">sunitaq780@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>Please allow a reasonable time for replies; responses are handled manually by the developer.</p>
